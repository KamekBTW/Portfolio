	insert: change heap and graph

M1: Diameter
	Shortest path

M2: Density/Cluster coefficient
	# open triangles/# closed triangles
	open: A-B-C
	closed: A-B-C-A

M3: Top k open triangles
	Store in max heap
	cannot recompute after insertion
	score(t) = sum of weights of the two edges

M4: Top - k neighbors (node, vector)
	vector = {w1,w2,...,wn}
	feature = {f1,f2,..,fn}
	score(node, vector) = Dotproduct(vector,feature)
