I am a recent graduate of University of California Santa Barbara with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have over five years experience in computer programming mainly in C++ and Python, but also with Java. My ability to collaborate with others to complete a large project is seen through the published CK-12 textbooks and my Capstone project. These projects also taught me how to work remotely and how to create a product that ensures quality for the user. These projects had their own editors, APIs, and interfaces, so I was able to learn very quickly and produce results within the first month.

From an early childhood I always had a deep passion for gaming. I have spent countless hours playing many different types of games, from MMOs and FPS to RPGs and platformers. I especially like browsing through smaller indie titles and fan games because that is where you see the most innovation in the industry. I want to gain more experience in the inner workings of game development and the gaming industry so I can fully see what I am capable of making. I believe I am the right fit for this role with all the long hours I have put into programming projects and playing fan games that helped me with bug testing and making sure anything I make is as perfect as possible.

# Math Interactives Internship, CK-12 Foundation
Summer 2018 - Summer 2019

CK-12 is a non profit organization that has made free digital interactive textbooks for students ranging from kindergarten to high school. I designed many of the interactive programs in the middle and high school math textbooks. The interactives were made with Geogebra, which is a math calculator/editor with a Javascript-based API. I was also responsible for testing and quality assurance for other content made by other interns.

# Senior Capstone Project
Fall 2020 - Spring 2021

Every senior in the engineering department was tasked to complete an engineering project in one school year. My team was given the project to create an autonomous marine vehicle that will automatically move towards and stay near coordinates given by the user. I was mainly in charge of the cellular communication and the main software program inside the system. Due to Covid-19, most of the project was completed remotely with only the final contruction being in person.
