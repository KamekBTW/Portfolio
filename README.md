# About Me
I am a recent graduate of University of California Santa Barbara with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have over five years experience in computer programming mainly in C++ and Python, but also with Java. My CK-12 internship and Capstone project taught me how to work remotely and how to create a product that ensures quality for the user.

From an early childhood I always had a deep passion for gaming.

# Math Interactives Internship, CK-12 Foundation
Summer 2018 - Summer 2019

CK-12 is a non profit organization that has made free digital interactive textbooks for students ranging from kindergarten to high school. I designed many of the interactive programs in the middle and high school math textbooks. The interactives were made with Geogebra, which is a math calculator/editor with a Javascript-based API. I was also responsible for testing and quality assurance for other content made by other interns.
