# About Me
I am a recent graduate of University of California Santa Barbara with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have overfive years experience in computer programming mainly in C++ and Python, but also with Java. My CK-12 internship and Capstone project taught me how to work remotely and how to create a product that ensures quality for the user.

From an early childhood I always had a deep passion for gaming.
